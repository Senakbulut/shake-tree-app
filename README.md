# shaking-tree-app
This project was created with **React Js** library and desired story animation was provided by **Sass** and communication was provided by local state.
The module package is also made with **Webpack**. The tree shakes for 3 seconds, then the apples fall and are displayed in the basket 1 second after the apples fall.

## Story
There is a tree with big, juicy and red apples on it. We want to collect those apples but we can't reach them.
Because the tree is very high. We have to shake the tree to drop apples. After that, we can put the apples to our apple basket.
